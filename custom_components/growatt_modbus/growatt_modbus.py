Growatt MIN-10000 Modbus Reader
Home Assistant Integration Module

This module handles communication with Growatt MIN series inverters via RS485 Modbus.
Based on Growatt Modbus RTU Protocol V1.39 documentation.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.7+
- pymodbus (pip install pymodbus)
- pyserial (pip install pyserial) 

Hardware Setup:
- Connect RS485-to-USB/TCP converter to inverter SYS COM port pins 3&4
- Set converter to 9600 baud, 8N1, no flow control

    # Writes reset and retry once on a transport error, exactly as the reads above do
    # (#375). They did not until then: they dropped the socket and returned False, with a
    # comment saying the *next* call would reconnect — so on a gateway or datalogger that
    # reaps idle sockets, the first read after a drop recovered silently and the first
    # write after a drop failed. The user saw a control that did not take effect and an
    # ERROR in the log; whether anything retried depended on having an external controller
    # that did so. Found by @alanmk while field-testing #358.
    #
    # Retrying a write is safe in this integration because every write is idempotent —
    # each sets a register to an absolute value, none increments or toggles relative to
    # the current one. Replaying one whose transport attempt failed cannot compound, and
    # the failure it prevents (a silently ineffective control) is worse than the one it
    # risks (writing the same value twice).
    #
    # Only transport-level exceptions retry. A register-level refusal arrives as an
    # isError() response, not an exception, and still fails immediately — retrying an
    # illegal-address write achieves nothing and doubles the log volume on the registers
    # known to reject writes (#371).

        the power setpoint — and they only mean anything together. Each one used to take
        the shared lock separately, so a poll could land in the middle of the sequence and
        any single acquisition could time out, leaving the inverter with authority granted

        TWO CONSTRAINTS, both easy to get wrong:

        1. Everything inside must run on ONE thread. The lock is an RLock, and reentrancy
           is per-thread — so a sequence split across several executor jobs would deadlock
           against itself rather than nest. Call the whole sequence from a single
           hass.async_add_executor_job().
        2. Keep the block short. The poll waits on this same lock, so a long batch delays
           polling for every entity on the connection.

        It is NOT a no-op without a shared connection. That was the original shape, on the
        reasoning that a direct client owns its socket outright and has nothing to contend
        with — true when it was written, false since #398 gave the direct path a
        `_local_bus_lock` and made a whole poll hold it. With the no-op, each write inside
        the batch took and released that lock on its own, so a poll could land between two
        registers of the sequence, and a mid-sequence acquisition could time out with
        authority already granted and no setpoint written — exactly the half-applied
        command this method exists to prevent, reached on the one transport that was
        supposed to be exempt from it.

        Both locks are RLocks, so holding the local one here and re-entering it per write
        behaves identically to the shared path.

        **The year is written as `year - 2000`, and read back as the full four digits.**
        Write 26, read 2026. That asymmetry is the whole problem — it is not in either

        detected the format by reading the register, which can only ever produce the
        four-digit form and therefore always wrote a value the inverter rejects (#393).

        Each field is written on its own with FC 0x06, spaced apart, in the reference's
        order. Its author notes that settings registers on that hardware generally need
        FC 0x10 and answer FC 0x06 with Illegal Function, but that the RTC block at 45-50
        is an exception and does take single writes.
