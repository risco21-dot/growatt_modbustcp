"""Legacy SPH profiles must map the grid import/export energy block (#395).

`SPH_3000_6000` and `SPH_7000_10000` had no grid or user *energy* register at all - only
*power* registers - while their V2.01 siblings mapped 1044-1051. The lookup is by name, so
it found nothing and the field kept its dataclass default: Export Energy Today and Total
were not reading the wrong register, they were reading nothing, and published a plausible
small number that never moved.

Confirmed on an SPH 5000 against ShinePhone and the Growatt cloud, and corroborated by a
second user's diagnostics showing `energy_to_grid_total = 3.4 kWh` on an installed unit.
